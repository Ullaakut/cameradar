// Package cmrdr provides methods to be able to discover and
// attack RTSP streams easily. RTSP streams are used by most
// IP Cameras, often for surveillance.
//
// A simple example usage of the library can be found in
// https://github.com/ullaakut/cameradar/tree/master/cameradar
//
// The example usage is complete enough for most users to
// ignore the library, but for users with specific needs
// such as creating their own bruteforcing dictionary to
// access cameras, or running their own network scan, this
// library allows to use simple and performant methods to
// attack streams.
